ec2.tf (AWS EC2 Configuration)

Resource blocks are set up to configure our ec2 instances. I have used an input variables file to allow us to set the number of instances created. In here I have also labels for billing purposes and statically set the AMI ID 

#######################################
rds.tf (RDS MySQL Configuration)

1. Resource blocks are set up here to define an AWS RDS instance with the specified configuration, including custom parameters and associated security groups with MySQL compatibility and InnoDB buffer pool size. Also setup to allow backup, monitoring and high availability across multiple zones

2. I decided to use AWS's Multi-AZ deployment to provide high availability without the need for managing a second RDS instance

3. Amazon Aurora was another option here following some research but I decided to stick with MySQL based on prior experience
